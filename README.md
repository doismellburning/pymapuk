# PyMapUK

An approximate map of regular Python events and groups around the UK.

Locations are approximate - lots of events will move around somewhat - but this should still help folks get a better idea of what's going on in cities or towns near them!

## Adding or Editing Events

Edit `events.yaml` and file a pull request on GitHub please!
